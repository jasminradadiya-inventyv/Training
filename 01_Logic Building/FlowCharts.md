# Flowchart Diagrams Repository

This folder contains a collection of basic flowchart diagrams designed to explain core programming logic, mathematical operations, series calculations, and pattern generation using clear and structured steps.

## Diagram Summary

1. **Maximum of Two Numbers**  
   Demonstrates how two values are compared logically to identify the larger number using conditional statements.

2. **Maximum of Three Numbers**  
   Explains the comparison process among three inputs to determine the highest value.

3. **Maximum of Four Numbers**  
   Depicts the logical steps involved in efficiently finding the greatest number from four given values.

4. **Sum of First N Natural Numbers**  
   Illustrates the loop-based approach used to calculate the sum of natural numbers from 1 up to a specified value `n`.

5. **Factorial Calculation**  
   Shows the sequential multiplication steps required to compute the factorial of a given number.

6. **Series: 1 −2 3 −4 5 -6.... (n = 6)**  
   Presents a simple alternating number series where the sign changes with each term.

7. **Pattern: 1, 12, 123, 1234 (n = 4)**  
   Illustrates a number pattern in which each new row extends the previous sequence by one digit.

8. **Series: 1! −3! 5! −7! 9! (n = 5)**  
   Describes the formation of an alternating factorial series using odd numbers with alternating signs.

9. **Pattern: 1, 121, 12321, 1234321 (n = 4)**  
   Demonstrates the construction of a symmetric (palindromic) number pattern with increasing and decreasing values.

10. **Pattern: 1, 232, 34543, 4567654 (n = 4)**  
    Shows a more advanced symmetrical pattern where each row begins with a higher starting number.

11. **Series: 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 9, 8, 11, 13, 13 (n = 7)**  
    Explains a combined sequence formed using elements of both odd numbers and the Fibonacci series.

12. **Series: x/1! − x³/3! + x⁵/5! − x⁷/7! (n = 4)**  
    Represents the Taylor series approximation of `sin(x)` up to four terms.
