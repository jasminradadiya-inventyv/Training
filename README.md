## 01_Logic Building

This folder illustrates how I approach algorithmic thinking before writing actual code.

*   **FlowCharts.md**: I created 12 flowchart diagrams to visualize problem-solving steps. These cover basic logic like finding the maximum of multiple numbers, mathematical series like Factorials and Fibonacci, and generating complex number patterns.

## 02_HTML_CSS

I created a responsive Login and Registration page using pure HTML and CSS.

*   **Tabbed Interface**: Implemented a toggle mechanism to switch between Login and Register forms without page reloading.
*   **Design**: Focused on a clean, split-screen layout with responsive styling for various screen sizes.

## 03_SQL_Queries

I practiced database management using a movie-related dataset (movies, actors, directors, reviewers).

*   **Quries_with_Solution.md**: Contains 50 queries progressing from simple to complex.
    *   **Basics**: Simple selects, filtering by dates, and pattern matching.
    *   **Sub-Queries**: Nested requests to find specific data like actors in a certain movie.
    *   **Joins**: Linking multiple tables to connect directors, actors, and ratings in a single view.

## 04_JavaScript_Tasks

Here I implemented scripts to handle arrays and asynchronous operations.

*   **Exercism_Javascript**: Contains solutions for Exercism JavaScript track exercises.
*   **TASK_1**: I built a script that takes an existing array, modifies it by determining specific elements to move, and creates a new combined array. Finally, I used a Promise to validate if the total sum meets a specific condition.
*   **TASK_3**: This follows a similar logic but introduces JavaScript Symbols. I used a Symbol as a unique key to store and retrieve the array from an object, demonstrating how to handle unique properties safe from name collisions.

## 05_RUST

This directory contains Rust programming tasks focusing on core language concepts.

*   **_2_task_control_statements**:
    *   Demonstrates the usage of control flow statements such as `for`, `while`, `loop`, `if-else`, and `match`.
    *   Includes examples of iterating over ranges, conditional execution, and handling infinite loops with break conditions.

*   **_3_structs_and_related_data**:
    *   Focuses on defining and using **Structs** to model data (e.g., a `Project` entity).
    *   Implements **methods** (getters and setters) for encapsulation.
    *   Demonstrates **associated functions** (static methods) and object instantiation.
